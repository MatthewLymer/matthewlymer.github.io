This post has been [6 years](https://github.com/MatthewLymer/lymersite/commit/2278c4ac7dcdd94ee4510b7e3112c7bc7aafe41d){:target="_blank"} in the making...

I'm sure we all have a never ending list of projects that we never get done, and it's not for a lack of desire to have them completed.  People's lives are busy, you have work, school, chores, family, friends, and other commitments.

Even so, I've made more progress on this website since my daughter was born than any other time.  It's not because I suddenly have a bunch of free time, quite the opposite, instead the lack of free time has prompted me to be more productive with it.


# Why is it hard to make progress?
There's lots of reasons why I haven't made progress on my projects, but here's the ones that are most applicable to me, and maybe to you, too:


## You don't work on your projects
This is obvious, projects don't get done if you don't work on them.  Since you probably can't materialize more free time, instead you can **make jumping back in easier** by reducing the overhead to make meaningful progress.  I now have my MacBook next to me in the living-room with the editor open.  

Additionally, consider **paring back less valuable activities**, the sense of accomplishment is worth more than the [disappointing 8th season of Game of Thrones](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/game_of_thrones/s08){:target="_blank"}.


## You spend too much time experimenting
You have the freedom to do whatever you want with your projects.  Experimenting is a fun way to learn new skills, and it's beneficial to try out new things.  However, if left unchecked, it will consume all the time you've allocated to work on your project, and you'll having nothing tangible to show for it.  

Instead, you should **timebox your experimenting** to something that still allows you to make tangible progress.  Experimenting is still very important, but best to avoid things that aren't demonstrably progressing your goal.


## You need to do everything yourself
In your projects you want to showcase your capabilities, which is why ["Not invented here"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here){:target="_blank"} is applicable for me.  Until seeing my co-worker [George Aristy's website](https://llorllale.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, I was spending my time writing a backend, learning frontend techniques, and researching infrastructure patterns, basically everything except writing articles.  Needless to say this was not a very efficient way to achieve my goal.

I should have **leveraged existing tools** like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com){:target="_blank"}, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} from the start.


## You need it to be perfect
"Perfect is the enemy of good"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good){:target="_blank"}.  Our projects are a creative expression of ourselves, so naturally we want them to be presented in the best light possible.  Unfortunately this results in many projects never being considered "finished" and release worthy.  

Instead, **get anything that provides value out the door**, what you release may very well be good enough.  Once released, you can make the decision on whether you want to iterate on it.


## You have too much going on at once
If you're like me, you probably have lots of ideas.  While having many ideas is great, trying to do them all at once prevents you from finishing any.

Instead, you can **write down your thoughts** in a notepad or notes software.  During the writing of this post I've had ideas of new content to write, so I simply jotted down the idea rather than shift away my focus.  Not shifting focus also gives the chance to prioritize it against the other projects.

# Final thoughts
I'll assume this 3 minute read wasn't a silver-bullet for you, but hopefully it has given a different perspective on managing your projects.  Take some time to think about what's holding you back and document them, having a problem in your face is a great way to start addressing them.
