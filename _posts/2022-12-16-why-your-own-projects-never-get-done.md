This post has been [6 years](https://github.com/MatthewLymer/lymersite/commit/2278c4ac7dcdd94ee4510b7e3112c7bc7aafe41d){:target="_blank"} in the making...

I'm sure we all have a never ending list of projects that we never get done, and it's not for a lack of desire to have them completed.  People's lives are busy, you have work, school, chores, family, friends, and other commitments.  

Even so, I've made more progress on this website since my daughter was born than any other time.  It's not because I suddenly have a bunch of free time, quite the opposite, instead the lack of free time has prompted me to be more productive with it.


# Why is it hard to make progress?
There's lots of reasons why I haven't made progress on my own projects, but here's the ones that are most applicable to me, and maybe to you, too:


## You don't work on your projects
This is obvious, projects don't get done if you don't work on them.  Since you probably can't materialize more free time, instead you can **make jumping back in easier** by reducing the overhead to make meaningful progress.  I now have my MacBook next to me in the living-room with the editor open.  

Additionally, consider **paring back less valuable activities**, the sense of accomplishment is worth more than the [disappointing 8th season of Game of Thrones](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/game_of_thrones/s08){:target="_blank"}.


## You spend to much time experimenting
You have the freedom to do whatever you want with your own projects.  Experimenting is a fun way to learn new skills, and it's beneficial to try out new things.  However, if left unchecked, it will consume all the time you've allocated to work on your project, and you'll having nothing tangible to show for it.  

Instead, you should **timebox your experimenting** to something that still allows you to make tangible progress.  Experimenting is still very important, but best to avoid things that aren't demonstrably progressing your goal.


## You need to do everything yourself
In your own projects you want to showcase your capabilities, which is why ["Not invented here"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here){:target="_blank"} is prelevant for me.  Until seeing my co-worker [George Aristy's website](https://llorllale.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, I was spending my time writing a backend, learning frontend techniques, and researching infrastructure patterns, basically everything except writing articles.  Needless to say this was not a very efficient way to achieve my goal.

I should have **leveraged existing tools** like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com){:target="_blank"}, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} from the start.


## You need it to be perfect
This aphorism ["Perfect is the enemy of good"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good){:target="_blank"} is particularly apt when working on our own projects.  Our projects are a creative expression of ourselves, so naturally we want them to be presented in the best light possible.  Unfortunately this results in many projects never being considered "finished" and release worthy.  

Instead, **get something that provides value out the door**, what you release may very well be good enough.  Once released, you can make the decision on whether you want to iterate on it.


# Final thoughts
I know this 3 minute read probably wasn't a silver-bullet for you, but hopefully it has given you the inclination to approach your own projects from a different perspective.  Undoubtably there's more impediments to completing your projects, and for those I recommend you document them.  Having a problem identified and in front of your face is a good way to force you to deal with them.
